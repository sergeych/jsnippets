h1. Some javascripts snippets for jQuery

This is private collection of useful scripts I had to write when moving from Rails project from prototype
to jQuery. While jQuery is in many aspects better than prototype, it misses some mechanics (or I failed to find it),
so I gonna add it there for future use in other migrations of such kind.

Try it on your own risk. The function of the module should be clear from its name.
